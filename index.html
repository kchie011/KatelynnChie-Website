        <p class="lead mb-4">About Me:<br><br>

        I am the eldest child and first in my family to go to a four-year college to pursue a higher education. I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology at University of California, Riverside because I have always been interested in how and why humans act the way they do, and more importantly because Iâ€™ve always wanted to go into a career that provides care to people with mental disorders. My ultimate career goal is to become a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) and beyond my undergraduate degree I plan on applying to a Masters of Science Program with a focus in nursing. With my great interest in mental health and enthusiasm for being able to care for people with mental disorders, becoming a PMHNP will allow me to expand my knowledge and apply it to serve the mental health needs of patients.<br><br>

        Currently I am a Peer Mentor at UCR's First-Year Mentor Collective. Being a first-generation student myself, I entered college disorganized and lost. Luckily, I took opportunity of the resources I was aware of and learned to navigate college better than when I started off. I signed up to be a Peer Mentor to help students in the same position as I was beginning college. I look to help people where I can and through mentoring I am also learning more about people and understanding other people.I hope to become involved with PsiChi and Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education (CARE). PsiChi is UCRâ€™s international Honor society in Psychology that aims to aid and stimulate academic excellence in the particular field of Psychology. PsiChi provides opportunities for scholarships, fellowships, conferences, workshops, internships, training sessions, community service in the field of psychology. In addition, joining this organization will allow me to join a community centered in helping students understand and expand their knowledge in psychology while also pursuing a career in the field. Having a community that I identify with is important as a support and motivational system that also allows me to participate in opportunities that will help me gain skills and experience in my career field. UCRâ€™s CARE is a support program with the purpose of ending sexual violence through intervention and prevention methods such as educating the community and providing resource programs to help survivors of sexual violence. I hope to become involved with CAREâ€™s education program as a SAVE Peer Educator as I want to help promote and educate the community about the various ways that sexual violence exists and prevention and intervention methods. Becoming a SAVE peer educator will allow me to grow as a leader as I help educate people on campus, learn more about sexual violence issues myself, collaborate with other students, and help students learn more about important resources on campus.
